Authentication

Authentication is basically the way a system checks that you really are who you
say you are before granting you access to your information. If someone tries to
impersonate you and fails the authentication process they won't be able to get in. So it's
a security step designed to keep devices and information away from the wrong people.
The most common example is the password. While passwords are easy to use they
also come with risks. They can be weak and easily guessed. Therefore many systems
now rely on much stronger methods such as Biometric authentication. For example it
uses fingerprints, face scans or voice recognition. Since these features are unique to a
specific person they are harder to replicate. Another option are keycards or security
tokens. These function almost like a digital key and without them access is denied.
Overall authentication is an essential step in cybersecurity because it helps protect
accounts data and systems from being compromised by unauthorized people.
